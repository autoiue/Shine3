# Shine 3

Shine is a software that let you control the real world in a predefined manner or using live data from controllers or sensors.
Primarily it supports DMX outputs using OLA and inputs through MIDI and live sound analysis.
Shine3 is yet again another iteration of the Shine Project. 

## The Block Engine

Inspired by MaxMSP, the block engine is not specific to Shine data types and routines. It aims to be usable for any live data manipulation.
