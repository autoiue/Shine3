# Shine 3

Shine is a software that let you control the real world in a predefined manner or using live data from controllers or sensors to enable any live performance.

Primarily it will support Arduino and Raspberry PI, MIDI, DMX using OLA and live sound analysis using Minim.
Shine3 is yet again another iteration of the Shine Project.

## The Block Engine

Inspired by MaxMSP, the block are small programs that have inputs and outputs. The block engine enables interconnections between these blocks.

## Develop your own blocks

You have two possibilities to implement a block :

#### Java

You write a Java class that extends the default Block class.
You can find the documentation here : [pr0csynth.github.io/Shine3/docs](https://pr0csynth.github.io/Shine3/docs).

#### Javascript

Or you could write a Javascript file that will be using a simple API.

Documentation to come.
